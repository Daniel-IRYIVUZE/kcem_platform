## Key Technical Features

### Offline-First Architecture
- **Hive** local cache with 24-hour TTL for all API responses
- Mutation queue stores POST / PATCH / DELETE operations when offline
- `OfflineSyncService` replays the queue automatically on reconnect
- Empty-state UI shown (never fake data) when cache is cold

### Central African Time (CAT = UTC+2)
All dates and times displayed throughout the app use `CatDateUtils`:

| Method | Example Output |
|---|---|
| `formatDate(dt)` | `31/3/2026` |
| `formatDateTime(dt)` | `31/3/2026  09:00 CAT` |
| `formatTime(dt)` | `09:00 CAT` |
| `timeAgo(dt)` | `5m ago`, `3h ago`, `2d ago` |
| `greeting()` | `Good morning` / `Good afternoon` / `Good evening` |

All backend timestamps are stored as UTC; the utility adds the 2-hour CAT offset for display.

### QR Code System
- Each waste listing gets a unique `qr_token` from the backend
- Hotel's listing card shows a compact QR preview; tap to enlarge to full-screen dialog
- Driver taps "Scan QR" on the collection screen; `mobile_scanner` reads the token
- Backend verifies the token and advances collection status to `collected`
- Multi-stop queue: after scanning one listing the next one in the queue is automatically promoted

### PDF Reports
Using the `pdf` + `printing` packages with EcoTrade logo:
- **Driver Collection History** — table of all collections for selected period
- **Driver Earnings** — transaction table with period totals and all-time total
- Both include EcoTrade Rwanda logo header, blue summary stats row, blue-header table, and branded footer
- Shared via native OS share sheet on all platforms

### State Management (Riverpod)
All data flows through typed Riverpod providers:
- `authProvider` — authentication state
- `businessListingsProvider` — hotel's own listings with bids
- `businessCollectionsProvider` — hotel's collections
- `driverRouteProvider` — driver's daily route (synthesised from collections)
- `transactionsProvider` — earnings / transaction history
- `openListingsProvider` — marketplace listings
- `notificationsProvider` — in-app notification feed
- And more in `core/providers/app_providers.dart`

### Real OpenStreetMap Maps (`flutter_map`)
- **Marketplace** — all open listings plotted at real hotel GPS coordinates
- **List Waste** — tap-to-move pin for selecting pickup location
- **Navigation** — driver route map with stop markers
- **Live Tracking** — hotel sees driver's real-time GPS + ETA (30 km/h city estimate)

---

## GreenScore System

GreenScore is calculated on the backend when a collection is marked **Completed** and reflected immediately in the user's profile.

**Formula:**
```
score = min(100, total_kg_or_litres / 100)
```
Every 100 kg / L of waste collected = 1 point, capped at 100.

**Tiers (consistent across mobile and web):**

| Tier | Score |
|---|---|
| Eco Beginner | 0 – 39 |
| Eco Starter | 40 – 59 |
| Eco Champion | 60 – 79 |
| Eco Master | 80 – 100 |

Displayed via the `GreenScoreCard` shared widget (circular progress indicator + tier label).

---

## Environment / Configuration

The API base URL is set in `lib/core/services/api_service.dart`:

```dart
static const String _baseUrl = 'https://api.ecotrade-rwanda.com/api';
```

To use a local backend during development, change this to `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api` (Android emulator) or `http://localhost:8000/api` (Chrome / Windows).
